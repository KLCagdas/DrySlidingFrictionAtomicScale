# DrySlidingFrictionAtomicScale
This code models a simulation of dry sliding friction experiments done with FFM. By calculating friction between a substrate that is thought to be a one-dimensional chain of atoms and a single sliding atom, varying materials can be worked with the model by changing attributes.
