# DrySlidingFrictionAtomicScale
This code models a simulation of dry sliding friction experiments done with FFM. It uses calculations deprived from total potential energy to shape the motion of atoms. It also calculates total potential energy for a possible need. By changing attributes in the file variables.m, varying materials can be worked.
